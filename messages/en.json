      "school": "At school, I was one of those students who always topped the class. But things changed in high school—I fell in love, and my grades fell with me. By the time I graduated, I found myself studying a major I didn’t really care about, feeling a little lost about what I truly wanted to do.",
      "programming": "That changed when I discovered programming. It started with a simple curiosity, but soon I realized I had both a deep interest and a bit of a knack for it. During my junior year, I made the decision to switch paths entirely. I spent nights and weekends teaching myself computer science, writing small programs, and building things just for fun.",
      "graduation": "After graduation, all that effort paid off—I landed a solid offer in the tech industry, and I’ve been growing in this field ever since. Looking back, every misstep and detour somehow led me here, to a career I genuinely love."
