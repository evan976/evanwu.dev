### What do employers look for in a video editing resume?

Employers look for candidates with essential video editing skills,  relevant experience you can demonstrate, and an educational background in video editing. Popular skills for aspiring video editors may include expertise in using video editing platforms and the ability to communicate well with others:

- **Video editing software:** Depending on your employer, video editors typically work within a specific video editing software to piece a project together. You should highlight the software you’re proficient in on your resume, such as Adobe Premiere or DaVinci Resolve.

- **Creativity:** As a video editor, you serve the role of a storyteller. You take different video clips and put them together to tell a complete story. To do so, you must have strong creative instincts.

- **Communication:** To become a video editor, it’s important that you work well with others through strong verbal communication skills. Video editors often serve as one part of a much larger post-production team, so it’s beneficial that you know how to communicate and be a team player.

- **Attention to detail:** As a video editor, you should be detail-oriented. You will structure video clips together and arrange them in the order requested by the director, producer, or other post-production team members.
