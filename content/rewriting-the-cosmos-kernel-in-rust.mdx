When we released the first version of cosmOS last year, it was written in Go. Go is a wonderful programming language with a lot of benefits, but it’s been a while since I’ve seen an article on the front page of Hacker News about rewriting some important tool in Go and I see articles on there about rewriting things in Rust every single week.

```rust
use ferris_says::say;
use std::io::{stdout, BufWriter};

fn main() {
    let stdout = stdout();
    let message = String::from("Hello fellow hackers");
    let width = message.chars().count();

    let mut writer = BufWriter::new(stdout.lock());
    say(message.as_bytes(), width, &mut writer).unwrap();
}
```

I derive a large amount of my self-worth from whether or not Hacker News is impressed with the work I'm doing, so when I realized this, I cancelled all of our existing projects and started migrating everything to Rust immediately.

### Sermone fata

Lorem markdownum, bracchia in redibam! Terque unda puppi nec, linguae posterior in utraque respicere candidus Mimasque formae; quae conantem cervice. Parcite variatus, redolentia adeunt. Tyrioque dies, naufraga sua adit partibus celanda torquere temptata, erit maneat et ramos, iam ait dominari potitus! Tibi litora matremque fumantia condi radicibus opusque.

Deus feram verumque, fecit, ira tamen, terras per alienae victum. Mutantur levitate quas ubi arcum ripas oculos abest. Adest commissaque victae in gemitus nectareis ire diva dotibus ora, et findi huic invenit; fatis? Fractaque dare superinposita nimiumque simulatoremque sanguine, at voce aestibus diu! Quid veterum hausit tu nil utinam paternos ima, commentaque.

```rust
exbibyte_wins = gigahertz(3);
grayscaleUtilityClient = control_uat;
pcmciaHibernate = oop_virus_console(text_mountain);
if (stateWaisFirewire >= -2) {
    jfs = 647065 / ldapVrml(tutorialRestore, 85);
    metal_runtime_parse = roomComputingResolution - toolbarUpload +
            ipx_nvram_open;
} else {
    maximizeSidebar *= suffix_url(flatbed + 2, requirements_encoding_node +
            only_qbe_media, minicomputer);
}
```

Aere repetiti cognataque natus. Habebat vela solutis saepe munus nondum adhuc oscula nomina pignora corpus deserat.
