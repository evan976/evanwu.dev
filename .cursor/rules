# Next.js Project Rules

- Using the App Router architecture, use the `page.tsx` file in the routing directory.

- Client components must be explicitly marked with `'use client'` at the top of the file.

- Use kebab-case for directory names (e.g., `components/auth-form`), and PascalCase for component files.

- Prefer named exports over default exports, use `export function Button() { ... }` instead of `export default function Button() { ... }`.

- Minimize `'use client'` directives.

- Keep most components React Server Components (RSC).

- Use client-side components only when interactivity is required, and wrap them with `Suspense` with a fallback UI.

- Create small client-side component wrappers for interactive elements.

- Avoid unnecessary `useState` and `useEffect` as much as possible.

- Use server components for data fetching.

# Translation Rules

- Use plain and easy-to-understand language.

- Don't be too formal.
